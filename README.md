# Face-Mask-Detector

###### Face Mask Detector built with OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras using Deep Learning CNN and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.
###### The face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).
